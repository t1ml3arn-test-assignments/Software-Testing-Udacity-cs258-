# Important note

Please, **DO NOT RUN** this fuzzer from admin user or on your own profile. It can be dangerous. It is better to run the fuzzer on separate non-privileged user, in a sandbox or in a virtual machine.

## Input data

4 pdf files (chose whatever you like)

## Applications to test

- [STDU Viewer ver. 1.6.361](http://stdutility.com/stduviewer.html)
- [PDF-XChange Editor ver. 8.0.333.0](https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-editor)

## Results

I run 4 files for 500 times each for 3 applications. So, it was 2000 tests for each application. And there were no crashes `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` .
